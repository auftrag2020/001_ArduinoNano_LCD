/**
 * @page overview Overview
 *
 * The architecture of the SEG BasicSW provides an overview of how the BasicSW has
 * been designed and implemented. Since the BasicSW by itself does not constitute
 * a full application project, not all elements usually present in a typical
 * software architecture have been included here. For example, the dynamic
 * architecture cannot be completely described since it strongly depends on the
 * real time requirements of the final application.
 *
 * A software architecture description typically includes multiple views, each of
 * them equally important to understand how the software is developed.
